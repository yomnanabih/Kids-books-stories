    <p>“ Kids Books  and stories is a growing library of unique children’s books, literary resources, and textbooks for children and young adults, available online and for download primarily in a user-friendly pdf format.

        We aim to provide easy access to great free children’s books and educational resources, for the enjoyment of reading and writing, and to promote improved literacy and education, and thus improved lives.”
        
        Books are separated into categories for toddlers, children, older children, and young adults, we felt this easiest since reading levels vary significantly between countries, especially where English is not a home language.</p>

<p>
 We find the best way to use the pdf picture books is to print the pages and staple them or keep them together in a slip file or folder. Another great way to read pdfs is on an electronic device such as a tablet or e-reader. Chapter books may be printed and put in a file to read, but work better on a tablet, phone, or e-reader.

This is a very cost-effective way to ensure children can have many great books to read over and over. Books can also be easily changed depending on your child’s interest, and pages can even be drawn on, as replacing pages is so easy to do.

Children often are not very careful with books when they are young, and a printed copy can easily be used for everyday play, and if you like the books, again, you can

buy the hard copy and keep it aside for later (when your child hopefully has learnt to look after their favourite things a little better).

Another great advantage of printable pdf books is for colouring books. Electronic format colouring books need not be thrown away when the pages are used! And you can print many copies of the same page for fun trial and error colouring, allowing your child to keep the best ones for use in the flip file or scrapbook.

Again, if you do like the book, and your child wants to read it over and over again, the easiest way to get a convenient hard copy, is to buy a copy!

Alphabet and learning to read interactive series are now available in both pdf and in an editable open document form under the files tab. There are no restrictions on the use of these files, however, we appreciate it if you link to our site as the source.</p>
